9. we say-and generally believe-that "there is no place like home", home is where the heart is
10. The human habit of building home has a long history
11. Anthropologists think home building began with very simple round huts, similar to the shelter still build in part of Africa today.
12. tree branched were leaned up against on another 倾斜的靠在一起
13. ribs of an umbrella 雨伞的肋骨
14. it's from these round,tend-like structures that the first solid dwelling probably evolved
15. as the tents became larger and more elaborate,they became the center of family life,and the place where the family's possessions could be kept
16. In other words,these structures became home, the heart of the human territory
17. Round huts progressed from being temporary shelter,made of wood and skins and leaves, into s tronger,more permanent structures build of stone.
18. progress from ... into ... 从...发展成...
19. But even through stone structures were stronger,there was still a problem,the round shape made it difficult to combine it with other structures
20. this difficulty was overcome with delevement of the cube ,or box shape
21. the box shape was a marjor development in home construction
22. By making the sides of home rectangular,
23. the room was invented
24. after the room came the multi-unit dwelling: the apartment house.
25. 10000 years ago,the method of building led to the contruction of cluster of rectangular buildings that made up first complex human settlements
26. Today the box shape not only survives but also remains the basis of our domestic dwellings. 家庭住宅的基础
27. the homes of today still contain some ancient features.
28. Around the house itself 在房子本身周围
29. there's an outer perimeter--the symbolic boundary of ancient home territory
30. Today the boundary is often marked by a barrier,like a fence,a wall or a hedge 栅栏 围墙 篱笆
31. we surround our home with a grass lawn,like our ancestors surrounded theirs with pastures for thier livestock 我们用草坪围绕我们的家，就像我们的祖先用牧场围绕他们的家一样，为他们的家畜提供食物
32. humans are more sociable than in ancient times,and so we allow others to enter the home territory,especially the outer boundary
33. we let outsiders enter the first of the private areas,the hallway,whitch is inside the solid wall of the home itself
34. This is where we retreat,like any animal to its den，whenever we are at our most vulnerable
